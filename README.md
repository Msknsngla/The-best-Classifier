# The-best-Classifier


This notebook is for the final project of my Machine learning course offered by the IBM on coursera. 
<br>
The aim of this project was the predict whether a person will pay off his loan or not using the data available on kaggle. The notebook implements 4 classification algorithms and compares the results obtained using three different evaluation metrics. <br>

<h3> CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS </H3>
<ul>
  <li> K Nearest Neigbours </li>
  <li> Decision Trees </li>
  <li> Logistic Regression </li>
  <li> Support Vector Machine </li>
</ul>

<h3> EVALUATION METRICS </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> F1-score</li>
  <li> Jaccard similarity score </li>
  <li> Logloss </li>
</ul>
